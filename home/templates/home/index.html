        <h3>We all know that parenting a neurodivergent child differs from parenting a neurotypical child. 
            However, many issues extend beyond childhood, and achieving independence and general adult functioning can be very challenging. 
            Often, parental support remains lifelong. Whether your adult child is still largely dependent on you or has already moved out, you'll find support and answers to most of your questions here. 
            Welcome to the community.</h3>
